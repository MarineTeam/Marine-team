# Media Library

A Subsplash-style media library: Auth0 login, an admin CMS for managing
series/categories/videos/files, video hosted on Bunny Stream, and downloadable
files hosted on Bunny Storage.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Prisma + PostgreSQL
- `@auth0/nextjs-auth0` for login/session (Regular Web Application flow)
- Bunny Stream (video) + Bunny Storage (files), uploaded directly from the
  browser via TUS so large files never pass through the app server

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in real values:
   - A Postgres connection string (`DATABASE_URL`)
   - An Auth0 "Regular Web Application" (`AUTH0_DOMAIN`, `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`,
     `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AUTH0_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)
     - In the Auth0 app settings, set Allowed Callback URLs to
       `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` and Allowed Logout URLs to
       `http://localhost:3000`
   - `ADMIN_EMAILS`: comma-separated emails granted the `ADMIN` role on login
   - A Bunny Stream video library (`BUNNY_STREAM_*`) and a Bunny Storage zone
     with a public pull zone (`BUNNY_STORAGE_*`)
     - If the Stream library has **Token Authentication** enabled (Library ->
       Security in the Bunny dashboard), also set
       `BUNNY_STREAM_TOKEN_AUTH_KEY` to the "Token Authentication Key" shown
       there (a different secret from `BUNNY_STREAM_API_KEY`) — otherwise
       the video player and thumbnails will 404. Leave it unset if token
       auth is off.
2. Install dependencies and generate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Push the schema to your database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
4. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## How it works

- **Public site** (`/`, `/series/[slug]`, `/videos/[slug]`): browse published
  categories/series, watch videos (embedded Bunny Stream player), download
  files. Content flagged `memberOnly` requires login.
- **Auth**: `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, `/auth/callback` are handled
  automatically by the Auth0 SDK's `proxy.ts` (Next.js 16 renamed Middleware
  to Proxy). Logging in with Auth0 only proves identity — it does **not**
  grant access by itself. Every login attempt gets a `User` row (so it's
  visible at `/admin/users`), but `getCurrentUser()` only treats someone as
  logged in once their row's `authorized` flag is true. Emails in
  `ADMIN_EMAILS` self-authorize as `ADMIN` on first login (so you always
  have a way in); everyone else shows up under "Pending login attempts" at
  `/admin/users` until an admin clicks **Grant access** — or you can
  pre-authorize an email there before they ever log in. Someone who isn't
  authorized yet sees "Access not authorized" in the Navbar instead of
  being treated as a member.
- **Admin CMS** (`/admin`, gated to `ADMIN` role): manage categories, series,
  videos, and files. Video upload creates a placeholder in Bunny Stream,
  signs a TUS upload session, and streams the file straight from the
  browser to Bunny; small files (≤4.5MB) are uploaded to Bunny Storage via
  the server.
- **Bunny Stream playback**: `bunnyStreamEmbedUrl()` and
  `bunnyStreamThumbnailUrl()` (`src/lib/bunny.ts`) build the iframe/thumbnail
  URLs fresh on every request. If `BUNNY_STREAM_TOKEN_AUTH_KEY` is set, they
  sign a short-lived `token`/`expires` pair per Bunny's token authentication
  formula (`sha256_hex(tokenAuthKey + videoId + expires)`); if it's unset,
  plain unsigned URLs are used instead.

## Useful scripts

- `npm run db:studio` — browse the database with Prisma Studio
- `npm run build` — production build
